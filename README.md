# ANE
Anemachi is my website, and this repository holds every micro service used in it

It is also private for now, this github repository is purely temporary as git.ane.jp.net is still missing

# Creating Services

First off, install the respective service manually (for now)
Run `cat ExampleRCService | sed "s/%NAME/INSERT NAME HERE/"` to create a service file, you will have to manually write it into the jail's location
