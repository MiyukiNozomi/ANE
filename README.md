# 
Anemachi is my website, and this repository holds every micro service used in it
This github repository is purely temporary as git.ane.jp.net is still missing

# Should I run anything on this?
No. I also hardcoded a lot of things during this project (mostly pathnames, but still, you shouldn't run this.)

# Creating Services

First off, install the respective service manually (for now)
Run `cat ExampleRCService | sed "s/%NAME/INSERT NAME HERE/"` to create a service file, you will have to manually write it into the jail's location

# Contributing
Don't, if you think anything is off, open an issue.
I will not merge any PRs unless they're so critical that I absolutely need to change it.
